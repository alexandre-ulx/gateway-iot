IoT Gateway Endpoint with Drogon and clickHouse
================================

This project is a high-performance gateway built using the Drogon Framework in C++. It serves as a secure and efficient endpoint for receiving, processing, and managing data from IoT devices in real time.

Security: HTTPS support, token-based authentication, and easy TLS integration.
Performance: Low-latency, asynchronous request handling with lightweight in-memory storage.
Modularity: Scalable and extensible design, ready for future integrations with databases, message queues, and protocols like MQTT/Kafka.
Applications: Perfect for IoT hubs, sensor data collection, remote device control, and more.
